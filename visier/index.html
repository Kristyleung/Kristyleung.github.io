                    <h3>Gathering domain knowledge</h3>
                    <p>Workforce Planning (WFP) is a powerful application that allows users to project and analyze labor
                        supply and demand based on economic factors by creating plans. During my 12-month work term as a
                        UX Design Intern at Visier, I spent the majority of my time dedicated to designing features with
                        the PM and Design Lead of WFP.</p>
                    <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
                    <p>To better understand the brand, we did a deep dive into the creative processes of a Cirque du
                        Soleil production. Every show begins with seeking within their diverse team of performers who
                        represent over 40 nationalities. Extraordinary artists specializing in African dancing, Peking
                        opera, and many other are asked to speak about their artistic journeys. Their stories and
                        talents are then extracted, elaborated and materialized into narrative driven productions shared
                        with the world. This was it. This was Cirque’s secret ingredient to artful productions: the
                        ability to bring dreams into reality.</p>
                    <p>Upon speaking to the development team, I learned that WFP could not allow multiple users to edit
                        simultaneously edits to a plan because a single edit generate changes to values across the grid.
                        Unsurprisingly, this constraint added a new layer of complexity to my mental model of the
                        application’s behavior.</p>

                                plan

                <div class="col-11 col-md-8 m-auto">
                    <p>This sketch details one of many early attempts to visually represent the behavior of the
                        plan-sharing feature: a switch that could be toggled by an editor to turn editing capabilities
                        on and off to allow another user to edit. However, certain back-end complications surfaced which
                        required the user to manually refresh the plan in order for the sharing status to change. The
                        toggle did not provide adequate visual cues to support this behavior.</p>
                    <h3>Taking a step back</h3>
                    <p>At this point in the design process, I was bogged down by concerns like: How are rights of the
                        shared users are specified? How multiple users with editing rights determine the sole current
                        editor? How would an editor know to relinquish their role for another user? In moments like
                        this, I returned to the prompt: “What might this look like if it were easy?” (borrowed from Tim
                        Ferriss) which I often pondered during my work term at Visier. Since I was consistently facing
                        new data or metric related concepts that I did not understand, I used this question to unshackle
                        myself from the complexities and regain my bearings. So if designing the sharing feature were
                        easy, a plan would, at the very least, would need the following things:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The ability to give another user editing or reading access to a plan</li>
                        <li>A simple method for an editor to start and end editing</li>
                        <li>A clear indicator of who the current and only editor is</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After identifying these components, I was able to find a jumping off point and create a mind map
                        and another iteration of the interface sketch.</p>

                    <h3>The retrospective</h3>
                    <p>Through the process of completing UX concepts and specifications for new features, I have learned
                        the importance of finding the most feasible UX that supports the necessary functionality. To
                        achieve this, I learned to be meticulous by questioning each moment in user interaction. Can I
                        simply this method by using fewer affordances? How can I make this new functionality more
                        accessible? Can I reuse an existing piece of UI or do I have to make a new one? If I propose a
                        new interface, is it worthwhile for the developers to program? Can it reused? During the start
                        of the work term, I often failed to ask these questions. As a result, I had to make many more
                        iterations of the mockups to achieve the completeness I would have had if I considered the
                        previous questions.</p>

                    <h2>Other Projects</h2>

                    <h4>Data Management Tool</h4>
                    <p>I worked with a Data Engineer intern to design and help implement (using HTML and LESS) an
                        overhaul for an internal tool that helped reconfigure, validate and load incoming data into the
                        Visier database. My contribution laid down the groundwork for the tool to continuously grow and
                        assist Data Engineers in other aspects of their work.</p>
                    <h4>WFP Reintegration</h4>
                    <p>Visier is currently in the process of integrating WFP into a new platform with other tools. By
                        doing so, WFP will be more effective in sharing their plans, forecasts and budgets to the
                        platform's business users. During the later months of my work term, I worked alongside the WFP
                        PM and UX Lead to develop a comprehensive set of mockups which detailed end to end user work
                        flows of the application.</p>
