                    <h3>Understanding the brief</h3>
                    <p>National Park Service’s mission is to protect natural and cultural resources while simultaneously
                        providing opportunities for public use and enjoyment. This is guided by the agency’s
                        values:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To be a guardian of natural and historic resources</li>
                        <li>To advocate for consideration</li>
                        <li>To be an educator of heritage and legacy</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Unfortunately, public engagement with US National Parks (NPS) have suffered since the 90’s. With
                        a decrease in visitation by 20% per capita, the parks are now mainly visited by the elderly.
                        With many younger Americans disengaged, NPS is at risk of being unable to further its goals of
                        conservation and providing public enjoyment around natural and cultural resources.</p>

                    <h3>Taking on the challenge</h3>
                    <p>NPS makes significant efforts to facilitate recreation in parks, how can we help them achieve
                        preservation and conservation as well? Naturally, this led us to ask if it was possible to
                        achieve the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Resurface connections in a way that is unique and
                            meaningful to each visitor
                        </li>
                        <li>Instil a sense of responsibility and desire in visitors to
                            safeguard National Parks
                        </li>
                        <li>Motivate visitors by establishing an irreplaceable
                            connection to parks
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When we took a step back we realized that these were prompts to inspire a new generation to take
                        on a personal responsibility in conservation. Given the scope of the project, this was not a
                        realistic problem to grapple with.</p>
                    <p>Instead, we decided to identify a more realistic goal rather than directly designing for
                        conservation, which is the more challenging out of all the goals to strengthen a person’s level
                        of connection to parks. Before a person becomes a regular visitor and full supporter of the
                        parks, they first need to be aware of the parks. National parks are more than another outdoor
                        location - they represent a rich culture and symbol of America’s generational heritage. Thus, we
                        decided to focus on increasing this recognition. While our solution doesn’t directly solve for
                        increasing visitation, but it provides more of an opportunity for it to happen through
                        increasing recognition.</p>

                        in and out of map level and trail level to paint a mental model of the destination in relation
                        to their location and goals. For example, they may jump from maps to vlogs on youtube, to
                        reviews on trip advisor and images from other travellers on Instagram. These parallels between
                        these personal accounts allowed us to pick our moment to intervene.</p>

                        continuing on this relationship to extend the park-going experience. We also considered creating
                        a solution on the NPS website, but found that our solution would only bloat and create more of a
                        redundancy in their already info-dense platform. With this solution, the value to customers is
                        the ability to make quicker, more informed decisions through glimpses of a park experience
                        guided by a park ranger, and the value to NPS is an increase in brand recognition and the
                        ability to entice more young visitors online. In addition to gleaning insight from the types of
                        audiences who stumble on and use Trail Guides, the value to Google is to strengthen their
                        growing travel eco-system in service to this particular micro-moment, as well as to grow their
                        off-the-road trail experience on Maps.</p>

                    <p>This digital intervention for US National Park Service is designed for new audiences so that they
                        will be able to foster the values of natural and cultural conservation and activism while
                        encouraging the public use and joy of their parks and landmarks. This will allow NPS to address
                        concerns the future of its parks visitorship, as well as ensuring the protection of natural and
                        cultural resources.</p>

                        early in the process. This specificity gave us the freedom to dive deep and flesh out the
                        interactions inside and around Storybooks.</p>
                    <h3>Usability for young users</h3>
                    <p>Though we gathered insights from parents with younger children and successful storytelling

                        Morris Lessmore), we did not perform comprehensive user tests to validate our design. Developing
                        empathy for such a user who is only just learning to read is no simple task. To reexamine this
