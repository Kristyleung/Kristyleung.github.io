# Product designer with a passion for building equitable and purposeful systems 
## Currently a product designer at Electronic Arts. 

I've worked with organizations both large and small on identifying user needs throughout all phases of product development while practicing iterative design, testing, and delivery. I am happiest when Iâ€™m collaborating with diverse, cross functional teammates. I believe in using design to grapple with human complexities instead of paring them away.
