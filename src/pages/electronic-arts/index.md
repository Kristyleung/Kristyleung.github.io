# Enabling millions of players to play with anyone, anywhere

- Timeline: Ongoing
- Company: Electronic Arts

## Context

There’s always been a looming problem in gaming - players on one console can’t play with those on another.

![Players on one console can’t play with those on another.](./ea-player-silos.png)

Although players have accepted this reality to be the norm, my team and I have worked to break down these silos and bring players together in a way not previously possible enabling a new technology called cross-play.

![With the cross-play services I co-designed, our players are able to play with any other player in the EA network.](./ea-players-with-crossplay.png)

To create these cross-play services, I co-designed and continue to own all social coordination features required for players to play safely and fairly across platforms.

## Impact

Currently, blockbuster games like Apex Legends and Star Wars: Squadrons have already adopted crossplay functionality, which is defined by the design system I helped create. As a result, players of both franchises can now play with any other player across consoles and devices.
