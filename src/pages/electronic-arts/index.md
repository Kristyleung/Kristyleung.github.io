# A crossplay design system for Electronic Arts

![EA](./ea.jpg)

There’s always been a looming problem in gaming - players on one platform can’t play with those one another. Over the years, the technology to make crossplay a reality has significantly matured. That’s why I had the opportunity to help break down one of the last major barriers for players who just want to pick and play with people all over the world. Working alongside Shery, our design lead, I co-created an inclusive and intuitive design system that allowed players to play safely and fairly across platforms. I helped establish principles that drove player engagement for blockbuster games like Apex Legends and Star Wars: Squadrons.

I am currently continuing to create UX solutions that detangle the complexities of creating a safe and fun crossplay ecosystem for our millions of players.
