# Enabling millions of player to play with anyone, anywhere

Building a unified approach for gaming for all EA game titles

### The Challenge

There’s always been a looming problem in gaming - players on one console can’t play with those one another. Over the years, the technology to make crossplay, the functionality that enables players across platforms and devices, has significantly matured. Numerous game titles at EA were looking to implement this crossplay into their gaming experience. However, there was no centralized approach. Each game team had to navigate unchartered territory of this new technology for themselves. Last year, my teammates of EA’s Network Expansion Team proposed a solution that would spare game teams from the research and testing efforts this implementation would require. We seized the opportunity to propose a fully functionally crossplay experience design that each team could bring into their game.

### Impact

I am currently continuing to create UX solutions that detangle the complexities of creating a safe and fun crossplay ecosystem for our millions of players.

Working alongside another designer, our design lead, I co-created an inclusive and intuitive design system that allowed players to play safely and fairly across platforms. So far, blockbuster games like Apex Legends and Star Wars: Squadrons have already adopted principles from our crossplay system for their players.
