## Context

Organized criminal networks across the globe have caused an unprecedented increase in the illegal hunting and trading of animals. Traffickers exploit unsuspecting transport businesses by using them to smuggle their contraband.

In response to the increase of illegal wildlife activities, United for Wildlife (UfW), an organization led by the Duke of Cambridge, approached my team at Edenspiekermann and asked us to explore approaches to lower the rate of wildlife trafficking.

To tackle a problem of this complexity, it was important to understand the space and its actors: _How does wildlife trafficking work? Who are the key stakeholders? What are their pain points?_

## Stakeholders

### Key insights from transport business

As we learned about transport businesses we gained a key insight from a logistician from Bangkok Airways. He expressed that decisions surrounding route planning are based on outdated reports or historic trends. Logisticians have no real time data to plan routes that these businesses can rely on. This meant that logisticians were unable to combat traffickers and plan routes safely.

### Key insights from wildlife rangers

As we learned from wildlife rangers appointed by UfW, we learned that rangers would make reports when they detect any suspicious activity. But these reports would often get buried in a dense backlog, rarely reaching transport businesses in time if at all.
It was clear at this point that there was a disconnect between our two key stakeholders. I captured the journeys between UfW rangers and transport businesses in wildlife trafficking to identify the areas of disconnect and friction.

![We realized a point intervention would be enabling these two stakeholders to share vital information in a timely manner.](./taskforce-wildlife-ideal-journey.png)

## Goals

- How can we establish communication between rangers and businesses and leverage the knowledge of rangers to improve route planning for businesses?
  1 How can we help businesses make the most of this information and use it towards planning safer routes?

## Taskforce Wildlife

Our final solution, Taskforce Wildlife, allowed logisticians to propose a route and would then output a bespoke risk report based on recent and historic reports made by rangers. The risk report creates a direct communication channel from rangers to logisticians. I created a user journey that helped the team and client understand how the observations of rangers in the field would directly be equipping logisticians with the information they need to plan safe routes.

## A design system to support our product

Unlike many products on the market today, we knew a wildlife product needed to work with specific real-world constraints. For this reason, we established two major guidelines.

### Guideline #1: Prompt action without fear-mongering

The tool needed to present critical information and a ton of it. However, we knew that jampacking the tool with terrifying warnings and complicated jargon would only overwhelm transport businesses. The design needed to strike a balance between approachable and actionable without downplaying the severity or urgency of the issue.

_The design needed convey information in a manner that was approachable and actionable without downplaying the severity or urgency of what was at stake._

### Guideline #2: Provide accessibility

Rangers needed to be able to access Taskforce Wildlife while patrolling rural areas with limited technological access and send reports in real time. It needed to be lightweight, yet reliable. The design system needed to lean enough that loading time would not be compromised. I worked closely with the technical director to develop a library of responsive components fluid across all screen sizes and browser versions. We also opted for typography and high contrast visual treatments that would be communicative in smaller and older devices.

_We constructed a set of lightweight and responsive components so that rangers could load Taskforce Wildlife while patrolling rural areas with limited technological access._

### Impact

Taskforce Wildlife has since been released and used by rangers and logisticians regularly. United for Wildlife was very satisfied with how we approached the problem. This project was featured in a presentation led by the Duke of Cambridge at the 2018 Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference.
