       <p>Founded in 1984, Cirque du Soleil was created to reinvent the traditional circus by blending opera and ballet, and eliminating headlining performers and animals. Cirque revitalized the public’s interest in circus entertainment with this new format. In less than 20 years, Cirque created a new market that overtook century-old giants, such as Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey. We identified their secret ingredient to their artful and seamless prodution: the ability to <b>materialize dreams</b>.</p>
        
            <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>With over 180 million people who have already seen a show, there is rising concern that Cirque du Soleil has failed to continuously  innovate in a way that drives continued customer engagement, like they did in the late 90s and 2000s. Additionally the emergence of small theatre competitors, that offer new variety in acrobatic performances at lower costs, are converting the brand loyalty of customers from Cirque. This is evident in recent loss of revenue due to <b>declined ticket sales of 36.6 percent</b> over the past year</p>
